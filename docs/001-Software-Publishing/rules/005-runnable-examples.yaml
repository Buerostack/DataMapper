title: Runnable Code Examples Requirement

# Human Documentation
context: |
  Components lack practical, working examples, forcing developers to piece together usage patterns from documentation alone.

decision: |
  All components must include at least one runnable code example in the examples/ directory with its own README.md explaining what it demonstrates.

rationale: |
  Runnable examples accelerate onboarding, serve as integration tests, and provide copy-paste starting points for developers.

consequences: |
  Developers must create and maintain working examples. Examples must be executable without modification and included in CI testing.

examples:
  compliant: |
    examples/
    └── basic-usage/
        ├── README.md          # Explains what this example demonstrates
        ├── index.js           # Runnable code
        ├── package.json       # Dependencies
        └── .env.example       # Config template

    # Basic Usage Example

    Demonstrates core functionality of the component.

    ## Run
    ```bash
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env
    npm start
    ```
