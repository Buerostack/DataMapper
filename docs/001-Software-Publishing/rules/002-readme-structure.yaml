# Human Documentation
context: |
  README files vary wildly in structure and content, making it difficult for users to find essential information quickly.

decision: |
  All README.md files must follow a standardized section order and include mandatory sections.

rationale: |
  Consistent README structure improves discoverability, reduces cognitive load, and ensures critical information is never missing.

consequences: |
  Developers must structure READMEs according to template. Automated linting validates section presence and order.
