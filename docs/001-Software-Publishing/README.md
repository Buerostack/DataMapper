# 001: Software Publishing Rules

## Context

All software deployed in our systems, whether custom-developed or OTS (Off-The-Shelf), must meet consistent quality, security, and operational standards. Without unified publishing rules, we risk inconsistent deployments, security vulnerabilities, and operational failures across our software portfolio.

## Decision Summary

We enforce identical publishing requirements for all software types:
- Custom-made internal software
- Third-party OTS software
- Open-source dependencies
- Commercial software packages

All software must pass the same validation gates before being published or adopted into our infrastructure.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent quality across all software sources
- Reduced security risk from unvetted OTS software
- Clear acceptance criteria for third-party software adoption
- Automated validation prevents human error

**Negative:**
- Additional overhead when adopting OTS software
- May delay emergency patches requiring manual review
- Requires maintaining validation infrastructure
